# docker-roundcube

Docker container for [Roundcube Mail](https://roundcube.net/)

> Roundcube webmail is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with an application-like user interface. It provides full functionality you expect from an email client, including MIME support, address book, folder manipulation, message searching and spell checking.

This package runs Roundcube over Nginx and PHP-FPM.

## Install dependencies

### Docker

To install docker in a Linux flavor [follow this instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/).

To install docker in other operating systems check [docker online documentation](http://docs.docker.com)


## Usage

The simplest method is to run the official image:

```
docker run -e ROUNDCUBEMAIL_DEFAULT_HOST=mail -d roundcube/roundcubemail
```

### Configuration/Environment Variables

The following env variables can be set to configure your Roundcube Docker instance:

`ROUNDCUBEMAIL_DEFAULT_HOST` - Hostname of the IMAP server to connect to

`ROUNDCUBEMAIL_DEFAULT_PORT` - IMAP port number; defaults to `143`

`ROUNDCUBEMAIL_SMTP_SERVER` - Hostname of the SMTP server to send mails

`ROUNDCUBEMAIL_SMTP_PORT`  - SMTP port number; defaults to `587`

`ROUNDCUBEMAIL_PLUGINS` - List of built-in plugins to activate. Defaults to `archive,attachment_position,contextmenu,contextmenu_folder,message_highlight,infinite_scroll,html5_notifier,thunderbird_labels,remove_attachments,zipdownload`


By default, the image will use a local SQLite database for storing user account metadata.
It'll be created inside the `/var/www/html` volume and can be backed up from there. Please note that
this option should not be used for production environments.

### Connect to a MySQL Database

The recommended way to run Roundcube is connected to a MySQL database. Specify the following env variables to do so:

`ROUNDCUBEMAIL_DB_TYPE` - Database provider; currently supported: `mysql`, `pgsql`, `sqlite`

`ROUNDCUBEMAIL_DB_HOST` - Host (or Docker instance) name of the database service; defaults to `mysql` or `postgres` depending on linked containers.

`ROUNDCUBEMAIL_DB_USER` - The database username for Roundcube; defaults to `root` on `mysql`

`ROUNDCUBEMAIL_DB_PASSWORD` - The password for the database connection

`ROUNDCUBEMAIL_DB_NAME` - The database name for Roundcube to use; defaults to `roundcubemail`

Before starting the container, please make sure that the supplied database exists and the given database user
has privileges to create tables.

Run it with a link to the MySQL host and the username/password variables:

```
docker run --link=mysql:mysql -d roundcube/roundcubemail
```

### Advanced configuration

Apart from the above described environment variables, the Docker image also allows to add custom config files
which are merged into Roundcube's default config. Therefore the image defines a volume `/var/roundcube/config`
where additional config files (`*.php`) are searched and included. Mount a local directory with your config
files - check for valid PHP syntax - when starting the Docker container:

```
docker run -v ./config/:/var/roundcube/config/ -d filhocf/roundcubemail
```
